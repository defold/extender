# How to build on Windows
# * Make a shared directory between OSX/Win32 for test-data in Parallels Desktop
# * On the windows machine, open an msys terminal
# * Change directory to the new drive (E.g. X:  "cd x:") which was mounted for you by Parallels Desktop
# * Run "sh build-libs.sh"
# All files should be named and copied automatically by this script
